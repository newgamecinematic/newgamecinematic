## About Me

* **Focus** : Unity gameplay programming & rapid prototyping
* **Pipeline** : URP / New Input System / Cinemachine / DOTween
* **Interests** : Turn-based tactics, deckbuilding systems, systemic worldbuilding
* **Writing** : I document progress in devlogs and refine narrative + lore with consistency in mind

<br>

## Featured Projects

### In Progress: **Neo-Ether** (Psychological Noir Turn-based RPG)
> A dystopia where attention becomes currency — emotions, viewership, and power collide.

- **Genre**: Turn-based RPG / narrative systems
- **Core**: streaming-based society, meta-layer world structure, lore consistency
- **Goals**: solid systems + believable world rules + strong tone

<br>

### In Progress: **Territory War-inspired Turn-based Stickman Battle**
> Tactical 4v4 turn-based battles with “Fortress-like” aiming and strategic positioning.

- **Core**: turn loop + terrain/position play + readable UI feedback
- **Goal**: clean code structure first, then expand content

<br>

### Side Project: **Space Revolver** (Puzzle)
> A small puzzle project to explore mechanics-driven storytelling.
